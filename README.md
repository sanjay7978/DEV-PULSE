# 📖 Overview

DevPulse AI is an AI-powered Developer Intelligence Platform that analyzes GitHub profiles and generates comprehensive developer reports.

Instead of manually reviewing repositories, technologies, commits, and project quality, DevPulse AI automatically evaluates a developer's GitHub presence and provides recruiter-friendly insights within seconds.

The platform combines GitHub data, repository analysis, AI reasoning, and developer evaluation metrics to produce actionable hiring intelligence.

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Evaluating developers through GitHub profiles is difficult.

Recruiters and hiring managers often face challenges such as:

* Hundreds of repositories to review
* Inconsistent project documentation
* Difficulty identifying real technical strengths
* Time-consuming candidate screening
* Lack of standardized developer evaluation metrics

As a result:

* Strong developers get overlooked
* Recruiters spend excessive time reviewing profiles
* Hiring decisions become subjective

DevPulse AI solves this by converting GitHub activity into structured intelligence reports.
